# Knowledge graph

## Problem and backend

This example links documents, concepts, and entities so a related result has an explanation path. It uses **TinkerGraph** to isolate modeling from container and network variance. Read [core model](../architecture/core-model.md) and [TinkerPop](../backends/tinkerpop.md) first; use the [selection guide](../backends/selection-guide.md) before production.

## Model

- Nodes: Document/Entity/Concept
- Edges: MENTIONS/RELATED_TO/IS_A
- Key properties: documentId, entityId, conceptId, confidence, relationType

## Prerequisites and release boundary

Use JDK 21, commit `3e0fa7cb9e3bc70c2743aeebda2487f3e45e4907`, and the checked-in wrapper. Examples are not published; run this release fixture as a Gradle project from the release source checkout. In a consumer application, select only `bluetape4k-dependencies:<ecosystem-version>` and add the required graph module without an individual version.

## Run and observe

```bash
./gradlew :knowledge-graph-examples:test --tests "io.bluetape4k.graph.examples.knowledge.TinkerGraphKnowledgeGraphTest"
```

The test asserts that related entities are selected and that a document-to-concept explanation path exists. A failure usually comes from relation direction, concept linking, or the explanation traversal limit.

## Exercises and production gaps

Add one result-changing edge and assertion; repeat through the suspend API; then run a persistent-backend concrete test serially. Add disconnected and malformed inputs as diagnostics. This fixture does not prove throughput, clustering, authorization, tenant isolation, migration, backup, remote-driver timeout, or index quality.
